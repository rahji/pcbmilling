If you&amp;rsquo;re using Linux or macOS, you will need to install FlatCAM from source, which is a much more involved process. See the FlatCAM installation instructions for more information.</description></item><item><title>Milling Holes</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/holes/milling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/holes/milling/</guid><description>Milling Holes # Holes can be milled with a flat end mill or they can be drilled using a drill bit.
Milling allows for non-round holes and avoids having to switch tools when there are multiple hole sizes in the PCB layout.
The process of creating an .nc file for milling holes looks like this:

Drill File]-->|.drl|B[Generate

The size of the board is based on the size of the layout of the board&amp;rsquo;s traces and pads. It also includes tabs that keep the board from coming loose from the larger PCB blank when it is cut out.</description></item><item><title>Using DipTrace</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/gerbers/diptrace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/gerbers/diptrace/</guid><description>Exporting Gerber and Drill Files from DipTrace # All of the following is done in the PCB Layout application within Diptrace.

The website has several useful features:
Clicking a line of G-code will update the location of tool in the plot on the right half of the screen Conversely, clicking a point on a toolpath in the plot will move the cursor to the corresponding line in the G-code listing The &amp;ldquo;Digital Read Out&amp;rdquo; constantly shows the XYZ position of the tool at the selected point in the G-code The G-code can be edited in-place</description></item><item><title>Configuring FlatCAM</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/configuring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/configuring/</guid><description>Configuring FlatCAM Defaults # If this is the first time you are using FlatCAM on the computer you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at, you should verify that the application defaults are set to reasonable values. You will have the opportunity to override these values in future steps.
Open FlatCAM and choose the Options tab. Make sure &amp;ldquo;APPLICATION DEFAULTS&amp;rdquo; is selected, then change/verify the following values:

When drilling holes (as opposed to milling them), there will be a different .nc file for each size drill bit.
The process of creating a single .nc file for drilling holes looks like this:
