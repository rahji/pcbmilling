## Installing FlatCAM

If you're using a Windows computer without FlatCAM installed, you will need to download the `FlatCAM-Win32-8.5-Install.exe` file from [the downloads page](https://bitbucket.org/jpcgt/flatcam/downloads/).

If you're using Linux or macOS, you will need to install FlatCAM from source, which is a much more involved process. See the [FlatCAM installation instructions](http://flatcam.org/manual/installation.html) for more information.
