## FlatCAM Basics

{{< hint warning >}}
Note every click of a "Generate" button in the instructions that follow will create a new item in the "Project" tab. Deleting any unneeded items in that list will keep the project from becoming confusing. You can also hide the plot for a given item in the toolpath by double-clicking it and unticking its "Plot" checkbox.
