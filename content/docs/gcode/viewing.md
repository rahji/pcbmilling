## Viewing the G-code

Verify the G-code produced by FlatCAM by opening each `.nc` file, in turn, at the [NC Viewer website](https://ncviewer.com).

The website has several useful features:

* Clicking a line of G-code will update the location of tool in the plot on the right half of the screen
* Conversely, clicking a point on a toolpath in the plot will move the cursor to the corresponding line in the G-code listing
* The "Digital Read Out" constantly shows the XYZ position of the tool at the selected point in the G-code
* The G-code can be edited in-place
