## Editing the Generated G-code

G-code can be edited in [NC Viewer website](https://ncviewer.com/) or in a text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (using the [nc-gcode extension](https://github.com/Milys/NC-Gcode-VSCode)). Editing on the NC Viewer website has the benefit of seeing a plotted preview of the job being edited.
