The size of the board is based on the size of the layout of the board&amp;rsquo;s traces and pads. It also includes tabs that keep the board from coming loose from the larger PCB blank when it is cut out.</description></item><item><title>Non-Rectangular</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/cutout/non-rectangular/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/cutout/non-rectangular/</guid><description>Non-Rectangular Board Shape # While FlatCAM has a fairly simple method for cutting a board outline based on the extents of the board&amp;rsquo;s traces (see Rectangular Board Cutout), that method doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for cutting non-rectangular PCBs. The process below uses the board outline Gerber file that you exported earlier to create toolpaths for any board shape. Unfortunately, it requires an extra step of editing the finished .nc file.
