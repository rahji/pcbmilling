If you&amp;rsquo;re using Linux or macOS, you will need to install FlatCAM from source, which is a much more involved process. See the FlatCAM installation instructions for more information.</description></item><item><title>Configuring FlatCAM</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/configuring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/configuring/</guid><description>Configuring FlatCAM Defaults # If this is the first time you are using FlatCAM on the computer you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at, you should verify that the application defaults are set to reasonable values. You will have the opportunity to override these values in future steps.
Open FlatCAM and choose the Options tab. Make sure &amp;ldquo;APPLICATION DEFAULTS&amp;rdquo; is selected, then change/verify the following values:
Gerber Options Isolation Routing
Units: mm Tool dia: 0.</description></item><item><title>FlatCAM Basics</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/basics/</guid><description>FlatCAM Basics # While this website provides the steps needed to generate the necessary .nc files for the milling machine using FlatCAM, it would be worthwhile to look at the Basics section of the FlatCAM manual to get an overview of the process.
Note every click of a &amp;ldquo;Generate&amp;rdquo; button in the instructions that follow will create a new item in the &amp;ldquo;Project&amp;rdquo; tab. Deleting any unneeded items in that list will keep the project from becoming confusing.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ“ˆ Traces</title><link>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/traces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rahji.github.io/pcbmilling/docs/flatcam/traces/</guid><description>Traces # The process of creating an .nc file for the isolation routing around your circuit&amp;rsquo;s traces and pads looks like this:
